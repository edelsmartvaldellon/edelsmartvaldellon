# Edelweis Valdellon - Software Engineer

Pronounced as *ay-dell-wyse*.  
Yes, I’ve heard all kinds of versions, so don’t worry, I’m used to it! 


I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 9 years of experience building modern web and mobile applications.  
I’ve had the privilege of coding across the Philippines, Japan, and now doing my best to navigate the tech world in the USA.

Lately I've been working with React, TypeScript, Kotlin, Spring Boot, and AWS, but hey!! We're engineers: give me the language, and I’ll learn it, build it, and ship it.

## About me
🌱 I love building software that makes a difference in people’s daily lives.  There’s real gratitude in seeing others use and benefit from  the products I’ve helped bring to life.

🛠️ I’ve previously worked on market research platforms, printer systems, and firmware development.

🏥  Now, I’m excited to explore new domains, but not limited to, medical technology — especially meaningful to me as the only sibling not in the medical field. 

🧩 I've earned the nickname **“super engineer”** thanks to my flexibility. A challenge in any stack or domain, and I’ll see it through with quality and curiosity.

🏂 When I’m not debugging, I’m probably out shredding the gnar and taking edges on the mountains.

## Collaborations

💡 While most of my previous work has been for private codebases, this space is where I’ll keep building in public.  
🤝 I’m always open to **collaboration**, so feel free to reach out if you want to create something together!
